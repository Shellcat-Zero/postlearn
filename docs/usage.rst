Usage
=====

There are two interfaces to the library.
Anything that actually does something useful, like plotting the grid
scores or a learning curve, is available as a top-level function.

There are convenience classes built on top of these functions,
These classes take a fit estimator, and the training data (optionally test data).
The classes provide caching of predicted values and a few other conveniences.
